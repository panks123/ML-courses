1) What is the difference between Tkinter and OpenCV ?

Ans:
Following are the differences between Tkinter and OpenCV:

i) The tkinter package (“Tk interface”) is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit while
   OpenCV is a cross-platform library using which we can develop real-time computer vision applications.

ii) Tkinter provides a powerful object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI toolkit for GUI development while 
    OpenCV mainly focuses on image processing, video capture and analysis including features like face detection and object detection.

iii) OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library but Tkinter 
     is the library which only consist of tools to develop a GUI, it does not uses machine learning.

iv) openCV supports wide variety of programming laguages but tkint is just a python librry.
