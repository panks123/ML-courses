Q 1) Explain the f-string mechanism.

Ans: A new string formatting mechanism was introduced in Python 3.6 known as Literal String Interpolation or more commonly as
F-strings (because of the leading f character preceding the string literal). The idea behind f-strings 
is to make string interpolation simpler. To create an f-string, prefix the string with the letter “ f ”.
F-strings provide a concise and convenient way to embed python expressions inside string literals for formatting.  

Let,
>>>var=10

f-strings interpret the expressions inside of {} characters as Python. 
So, by saying {var}, we are instructing Python to insert the
 value of the var variable into our string.
