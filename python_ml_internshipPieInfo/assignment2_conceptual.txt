1.What is the differnce between Python 2.x and Python 3.x?

Ans: (i) Syntax of python 3 is easier and simpler than that of Python 2
(ii) Python 3 has Range() function to perform iterations whereas, In Python 2, the xrange() is used for iterations.
(iii) Difference in print function: In Python 2.x print function can be written without parenthesis for printing but in Python 3.x 
      print statement without parenthesis will give syntax error
(iv) Difference in integer division : In python 2 3/2 will give 1 but in python 3 3/2 will give 1.5.
(v) Strings are stored as ASCII in python 2.x but strings are stored as unicode in python 3.x

2.What do you understand by PVM?

Ans: 
Python Virtual Machine: 
When we run a Python program, two steps happen,
(i)The code gets converted to another representation called ‘Byte Code’
(ii)'Byte Code' gets converted to Machine Code (which is understandable by the computer)

The second step is done by the python virtual machine (PVM).
So PVM is nothing but a software/interpreter that converts the byte code to machine code for given operating system.
PVM can be called as the Python interpreter as Python is an interpreted language.

3.Write a comparison among list, tuple and dictonary.

Ans:
Lists vs Tuples vs Dictionary
(i)Lists are mutable,tuples are immutable, and dictionaries contain elements as key value pair in which keys are immutable 
   and values can be either mutable or immutable.
(ii)Lists are enclosed within [], tuples are enclosed within (), Dictionaries are enclosed within {}
(iii) Elements in lists are accesed using indexing by specifying the index of the element but in dictionary elements of dictionary 
     are accessed using the key specified within []after name of the dictionary variable
(iv)Lists and tuples can contain duplicates but in dictionary keys can't be duplicates although values can be duplicates
